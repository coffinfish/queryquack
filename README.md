# Query Quack
Query Quack was made at MetHacks2023 as a discord bot that allowed users to upload pdf files to query into them! It uses langchain and cohere.

The main AI portion was coded by Nina Dang @nina2dv during the hackathon. However, updates are currently being made as some modules have been deprecated. 

## Upcoming Plans:
- Update all imported modules
- Use a database to store the files instead of locally
- Hooking it up to a Raspberry Pi to run the bot 24/7
- A more comprehensive readme so others can implement this bot into their own discord servers. Unfortunately it would have to be run through their own software as the bot currently uses trial keys.
